# Python DSA Programs

This repository contains my implementations of various **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** using Python. The programs in this repo are meant to help me (and others) learn, practice, and understand fundamental concepts in **Data Structures** and **Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my early Python programs focused on implementing common data structures and algorithms. It's aimed at helping me solidify my understanding of how things like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching, and sorting algorithms work.

## Programs

### Arrays
- Implementations of basic array operations like insert, delete, traverse, and search.
- Examples of algorithms like **binary search** and **two-pointer technique**.

### Linked Lists
- Singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and reversal.
- Doubly linked list implementation with traversal in both directions.

### Stacks
- Stack implementation using both arrays and linked lists.
- Applications like balancing parentheses and evaluating expressions.

### Queues
- Queue implementation using lists and linked lists.
- Circular queue and priority queue implementations.

### Trees
- Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation.
- Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
- AVL tree and basic tree operations.

### Sorting Algorithms
- Implementations of sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** implementations.

## Usage
